Hi all,

It is great to know that you will be joining our MSc Data Science course in September. Below are some suggestions of resources and activities that you could carry out in preparation for the course. Of course, do tailor those to your academic background and work experience.

I am quite conscious that the material below is probably worth a couple of years of full-time study. The way that I see students approaching is mixing-and-matching, focusing on a few desired topics and sections, favouring gaining intuition rather than going deep into the technical details. I hope it makes sense, and that this is useful.

Best wishes,  
Luciano

# TL;DR

* Gain familiarisation with programming with Python.

* Take a refresher on introductory probability and statistics.

* Review concepts in secondary school algebra such as essential arithmetic/algebra, functions, graphs, logarithms and exponentials, and some introductory calculus and linear algebra as well.


# Longer Version


## Python

You might want to start with gaining some experience with practical Python for Data Science. Some examples of suitable resources here are:

* DataCamp's introductory Python for Data Science courses:
    - <https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>
    - <https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-science-in-python>

* the Carpentry series (e.g., <http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>).

* TL;DR? <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>


In addition to the above, you might want to browse/go through selected sections of the recommended textbooks:

* [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/)
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)



## Data Science Production Environment

As environment for doing the practical work, I would recommend starting with Google Colab (<https://colab.research.google.com/>), which is based on Jupyter notebooks. Some useful links are:

* [Introduction to Google Colab](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI): just for gaining a feel of what notebooks look like and of the interactivity and exploratory programming aspects; please ignore the Deep Learning stuff at this stage.

* [Overview of Colab Features](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb).

* [Markdown Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb).


Later on, you might find useful to have a local Python installation with **Jupyter Lab** on their machine. My suggestion is to go for the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (with [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba). Also, a good programming text editor/environment (e.g., Sublime Text, Visual Code Studio) alongside is always helpful.


## Mathematics Refresher

You may also want to take a refresher on pre-calculus (e.g., algebra, geometry, logarithms, exponentials, functions). This would be helpful with most units, but particularly for the machine learning and deep learning units. The excellent material of the Khan Academy is more than sufficient for this purpose, such as:

* <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus>

A refresher/quick introduction to differential/integral calculus and linear algebra will prove handy as well. Some resources from Khan Academy and from the wonderful 3Blue1Brown that I can suggest are: 

* <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus>
* <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra>
* <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus>
* <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab>
* <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr>




## Introductory Probability and Statistics

We have a unit dedicated to essential statistics and probability, but some recommendations that I usually have in preparation for the course are:

* for statistical mindset (accessible):
    + [Statistics without Tears](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/135/13568/statistics-without-tears/9780141987491.html)
    + [The Art of Statistics](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294/294857/the-art-of-statistics/9780241398630.html)
    
* for a more extensive but still accessible coverage, one cannot go wrong with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability).



And a useful primer on Data Visualisation is:

* [Fundamentals of Data Visualization (O'Reilly)](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)



## Looking Ahead

Time-permitting, if you are keen, you could preview some practical machine learning with Python as well. The book [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do) is quite suitable - the [author's (Andreas MÃ¼ller) lectures](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s20/schedule/) are more up-to-date with respect to the functionality of the Python packages involved. Also, there is the [DataCamp Introduction to Supervised Learning]((https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn), among others.
